This project's primary aim is to implement a
self-contained system for classifying handwritten
digits on the Raspberry Pi Pico using machine learning
techniques. The objectives encompass developing an
efficient machine learning model tailored to the
resource constraints of the Raspberry Pi Pico, ensuring
accurate handwritten digit classification. Additionally,
the project strives to integrate a user-friendly
interface, potentially incorporating a TFT LCD display,
to dynamically visualize and interpret digit
classification results. By accomplishing these goals,
the project aims to showcase the viability of deploying
machine learning applications on edge devices like the
Raspberry Pi Pico. Furthermore, it seeks to serve as an
educational and accessible platform, fostering
understanding at the intersection of machine learning
and embedded systems.
